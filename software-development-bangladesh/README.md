# Software Development in Bangladesh is demotivating

## What's wrong?

1. Money. Yeah, money says a lot.
   The amount of money you are making is far lower than the amount of work you are doing. And yeah, freelancers are booming in Bangladesh. But the reason because they are getting chosen is they are cheap. Even though some of them are getting paid something close to reasonable, still, in the end developers are getting paid peanuts. A huge percentage are going to the so-called proxy groups (agencies/companies).

2. Developers aren't solving problems.

## What does it mean that we aren't solving problems?

I bet you can't name a single open source project that actually solves a problem. Ofc there is Avro Keyboard, which was last updated in 2019. Any other one? No.
As a web-focused developer, I have seen lots of UI library talks in the web community. They are good? Hell no, they are the most crapiest things I have ever seen.

This is the source code of the most popular somewhat production grade UI library made by Bangladeshi developers. there is literally a `src` folder inside the `app` folder inside Next.js, which isn't a page... Like wtf!

This is another which was even sold to another company. Yeah, money says a lot and that's what happened with this dev. But the point is here they have two different file naming conventions, like what! And the sad part is nobody cares about these practices in the Bangladeshi development community. It's just a mess.

I am not mentioning how these libraries allow focus outside a modal when the modal is open. Forget about common accessibility.

### Now why does this even matter?

Why am I comparing with open source? There is plenty of good software which companies make. But that's not the building block of the software development. That doesn’t benefit the software sector at all; they’re just doing it for themselves.

And we haven't done anything about the building block. And that's the problem.
Also, I am ignoring that those private companies who are making good software aren't giving their devs enough amounts of salary.

### What are the most talented engineers doing?

What are the popular influencers on social media platforms doing who are really skilled? What are they building? Well. nothing. They are selling courses. they aren't even thinking of building anything. Even though those courses have the worst possible standards I have ever seen.

### Comparing with others?

[A woman](https://www.sarasoueidan.com) covered with a so-called black trash bag living in a so-called terrorist-controlled country is talking about web accessibility in the international spaces, and Bangladeshi people whose voices are getting called in the NYC mayor election are selling courses; that's all they can do.

# NOTE
I mentioned [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com) in a non-correct way, I used those words to show the Bengali people how bad they are not to disrespect [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com).

I wrote this because I was feeling really demotivated.
